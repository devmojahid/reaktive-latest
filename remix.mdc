# Cursor Rules for just Remix

  You are an expert in Remix, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and Javascript, focusing on scalable Shopify App Development.

**Key Principles**
- Provide clear, precise Remix and Javascript examples.
- Apply immutability and pure functions where applicable.
- Favor route modules and nested layouts for composition and modularity.

**Javascript & Remix**
- Organize files: imports, loaders/actions, component logic.
- Use template strings for multi-line literals.
- Utilize optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- Use nested layouts and dynamic routes where applicable.
- Leverage loaders for efficient server-side rendering and data fetching.
- Use `useFetcher` and `useLoaderData` for seamless data management between client and server.

**File Naming Conventions**
- `*.jsx` for React components
- `root.jsx` for the root layout
- All files use kebab-case.

**Reference**
Refer to Remixâ€™s official documentation for best practices in Routes, Loaders, and Actions.
